## What You Built — Vault's Native Agent Identity Model

This workshop deployed **HashiCorp Vault Enterprise 2.0.3** on EKS and wired it to enforce the five control objectives for agentic systems using Vault's **native AI agent primitives** — the first-class agent identity model HashiCorp ships in the product today. You configured the security primitives — Kubernetes auth, the OAuth resource server, the Agent Registry, ceiling-policy intersection, and Vault-side per-request Rich Authorization Requests (RAR) — at the layer where enforcement actually happens.

### Vault's Native AI Agent Support Is Deployed Here

HashiCorp's [native AI agent support in Vault](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/announcing-native-ai-agent-support-in-hashicorp-vault) is a released Enterprise capability, and this workshop runs it. Three native primitives carry the authorization model:

- **Agent Registry** — each agent is registered as a first-class identity (`uc1-agent`, `agent-uc2`, `uc3-actor`), distinct from human users and traditional non-human identities, with a `ceiling_policies` envelope on the registration.
- **OAuth resource server** — the IVIA-issued OAuth JWT authorizes the Vault request **directly** via the `X-Vault-Token` header. There is no `jwt_login`, no intermediate Vault token, and the legacy `jwt` auth backend has been **retired** entirely.
- **Vault-side per-request RAR** — `authorization_details` of `type: vault:path_access` narrow a token to the exact path and capabilities of a single request. **Vault itself** is the interpreter and the decision point.

The table below maps each workshop use case to the native Vault capability it deploys:

| What you deployed in this workshop | Vault native agent capability |
|---|---|
| **Use Case 1** — Vault Kubernetes auth binds the agent ServiceAccount to the `uc1-readonly` policy with JIT credentials (TTL 15m); the agent is registered as `uc1-agent` | **Agent Registry** — the agent holds a first-class registry identity. Because Use Case 1 presents no OAuth actor, its `uc1-ceiling` is inert (informational only); the `uc1-readonly` Kubernetes policy is the enforcement floor |
| **Use Case 2** — IVIA OAuth Authorization Code + PKCE → the user's OAuth JWT authorizes Vault directly via `X-Vault-Token` against the `ivia` resource-server profile | **OAuth resource server + On-Behalf-Of (OBO) delegation** — the human `sub` contributes the human baseline, the `act.sub`=`agent-uc2` actor contributes the `uc2-agent-ceiling`, tracked in the Agent Registry |
| **Use Case 3** — the delegated CIBA JWT carries `act.sub`=`uc3-actor` and `authorization_details` of `type: vault:path_access`, enforced by Vault per request | **Ceiling intersection + mandatory per-request RAR** — Vault narrows the token to the exact path/capability for that one refund and denies any request whose RAR path differs |
| **Use Case 3** — three-plane audit correlation: the IVIA approval, the Vault authorization and the RDS pgaudit write all carry the same `request_id`, so one query returns one row spanning all three | **End-to-end tracing and attribution** — the Vault record names both halves of the pair (the approving human in `auth.entity_id`, the agent in `actor_entity_name`), so the correlation reads "agent X acting for human Y" and is an equality on a shared id, not an inference from timing |
| All use cases — no standing privileges; every database credential is created for one request and destroyed after it | **Ephemeral per-request authorization** — the credential's life is the Vault role's TTL counted from issue, *not* the token's. Measured on this deployment a Use Case 2 access token lives two hours while the credential it obtains lives fifteen minutes, and the Use Case 2 MCP server hands its credential back the moment the query returns rather than waiting out even that. The token's expiry stops the agent obtaining a *new* credential; it is the lease that governs the one already issued |

### How the Native Layers Map to the Five Control Objectives

Vault's native model enforces a **policy intersection** — a request is permitted only if it falls within the overlap of every layer that applies to that use case. **The number of enforcing layers differs by use case**, because the identity each agent presents to Vault differs:

- **Use Case 1 — one enforcing layer.** The agent authenticates with its ServiceAccount JWT through the Kubernetes auth method and resolves to the `uc1-readonly` policy. It carries a registry identity (`uc1-agent`), but with no OAuth actor its `uc1-ceiling` does not self-apply — so the Kubernetes policy floor is the single enforcing layer. → *Objective 1: verifiable identity; Objective 2: no standing privileges.*
- **Use Case 2 — two enforcing layers in Vault.** An On-Behalf-Of flow. Vault intersects **(a)** the human owner's baseline (resolved from the OAuth `sub` entity → *Objective 3: actions tied to user intent*) with **(b)** the agent's `ceiling_policies` (`uc2-agent-ceiling`, resolved from the `act.sub` actor → *Objective 2: no standing privileges*). The per-request RAR is a third layer Vault supports and Use Case 2 does not use: the profile leaves it optional and the Use Case 2 login token carries none, so two layers is what actually runs. Beyond Vault, the credential itself is read-only by `GRANT` and the rows it returns are filtered by Postgres row-level security — you prove both by hand on the Verify User Access page.
- **Use Case 3 — three enforcing layers.** The same two, plus **(c)** the per-request `vault:path_access` RAR (→ *Objective 4: enforcement at the point of use*), which Use Case 3 makes **mandatory** (`optional_authorization_details=false`). A request succeeds only if all three permit; the ceiling can only *restrict*, never grant. The bypass test proves the RAR layer independently: a token whose RAR names a different path is denied even though the baseline and the ceiling both allow the target.

Objective 5 (correlated audit evidence) maps to Vault's native end-to-end tracing: the audit event carries the agent-registry identity and the approving human's entity, and the Use Case 3 agent stamps its `request_id` on the Vault request as `X-Correlation-Id`, so the Vault plane joins the IVIA and RDS pgaudit planes on the same id they use.

### Key Takeaway

Agent identity, the ceiling envelope, and per-request scoping are **native Vault capabilities you configured and enforced today** — not hand-rolled approximations and not a roadmap item. Vault is where the *authorization* decision is made: IVIA remains the issuer, delegation and CIBA-consent authority, and every decision about which credential an agent may hold is made natively by Vault against the registered agent's ceiling and the request's `vault:path_access` RAR.

Vault is not, however, the only thing standing between an agent and your data, and the workshop deliberately shows you the others. The credential Vault issues is read-only because of a Postgres `GRANT`; the rows it can see are filtered by row-level security keyed on the authenticated subject; a second refund under one approval is refused by a unique index; and the agent's pod cannot reach an unapproved endpoint because of a Kubernetes NetworkPolicy. Each of those is a layer that still holds on the day the identity layer is the thing that failed — which is the reason to have them. Teams adopting this model implement exactly the pattern you deployed here.
