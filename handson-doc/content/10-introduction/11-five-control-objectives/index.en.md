title: 'Five Control Objectives'

This workshop focuses on five control objectives for agentic systems:

1. **Verifiable identity** — every agent ties back to a cryptographically verifiable identity (workload ServiceAccount, user OAuth flow, or both) and is registered as a first-class identity in Vault's **Agent Registry** (`uc1-agent`, `agent-uc2`, `uc3-actor`), distinct from human users and traditional non-human identities.
2. **No standing privileges** — credentials are issued just-in-time and scoped to the request. Use Case 2's MCP server revokes each one explicitly as soon as the query it was issued for returns; Use Case 1 and Use Case 3 let theirs expire on a short lease (fifteen and five minutes). Each registered agent also carries a `ceiling_policies` envelope bounding the maximum it can ever hold when acting for a human.
3. **Actions tied to user intent** — privileged actions require demonstrable user consent (OAuth Authorization Code + PKCE for read access, CIBA out-of-band for writes).
4. **Enforcement at the point of use** — Vault is the decision point. The IVIA-issued OAuth JWT authorizes Vault directly via the `X-Vault-Token` header (the `ivia` OAuth resource-server profile), and Vault narrows the token per request through `authorization_details` of `type: vault:path_access`. Defense-in-depth still layers DB GRANTs + AWS IAM and Kubernetes NetworkPolicy underneath, so a compromise of any one layer doesn't bypass the others.
5. **Correlated audit evidence** — one `request_id` runs through all three planes: the IVIA decision log (who approved), the HashiCorp Vault audit log (which agent was authorized, for which human, scoped to which path), and the RDS pgaudit log (the write that landed). The Vault record carries the agent-registry identity in `actor_entity_name` and the approving human's identity entity in `auth.entity_id`, and the agent stamps the flow's `request_id` on the Vault request as `X-Correlation-Id` so all three join on the same key. Athena stitches the three planes into one row.

## Three use cases, in order

The workshop walks through three use cases in strict topological order — Use Case 3 is a strict superset of Use Case 1 + Use Case 2.

:::expand{header="Use Case 1 — Non-personalized read-only retrieval"}
A Strands agent runs in EKS with its own ServiceAccount (`uc1-retriever-sa`), registered in Vault's Agent Registry as `uc1-agent`. Vault's Kubernetes auth method validates the SA's JWT against the EKS OIDC provider, binds it to the `uc1` auth role (token TTL 1h, carrying the `uc1-readonly` policy), and issues just-in-time read-only Postgres credentials via `database/creds/uc1-readonly` (credential TTL 15 min) and scoped Bedrock STS credentials. Because Use Case 1 presents no OAuth actor, its `uc1-ceiling` is inert (registry identity only) — the `uc1-readonly` Kubernetes policy is the single enforcing layer. **Demonstrates Objectives 1, 2, 5.**
:::

:::expand{header="Use Case 2 — OAuth personalized read-only"}
The agent now requires a user JWT (Authorization Code + PKCE flow against IVIA). That OAuth JWT authorizes Vault **directly** via the `X-Vault-Token` header against the `ivia` OAuth resource-server profile — no `jwt_login`, no intermediate Vault token. This is an On-Behalf-Of flow: Vault intersects the human `sub` baseline with the `act.sub`=`agent-uc2` actor's `uc2-agent-ceiling` (two of three layers; the per-request RAR is optional for Use Case 2). INSERT attempts are rejected by DB GRANTs (Layer 2 enforcement). Egress to unapproved endpoints is blocked by Kubernetes NetworkPolicy (Layer 3). **Adds Objective 3.**
:::

:::expand{header="Use Case 3 — CIBA privileged + three-plane audit correlation"}
Privileged actions trigger a CIBA out-of-band approval flow. The resulting delegated JWT carries `act.sub`=`uc3-actor` (RFC 8693 Token Exchange) and `authorization_details` of `type: vault:path_access` (RFC 9396 RAR). Vault enforces the three-layer intersection natively: the human `sub` baseline ∩ the `uc3-agent-ceiling` (resolved from the actor) ∩ the **mandatory** per-request RAR. A bypass test confirms that a JWT whose RAR path differs is denied even when the entity's policy would permit the path. A single Athena query stitches the IVIA decision log, the Vault audit log, and the RDS pgaudit log into one forensic row, all three joined on the same `request_id`, and answers "Which user authorized this action, when, against what system, and how long did the credential live?" **Demonstrates all 5 Objectives.**
