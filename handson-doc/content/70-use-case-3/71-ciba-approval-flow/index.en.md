## How CIBA Works

CIBA (OpenID Connect Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication) lets an automated agent request user approval without controlling the browser session. The agent initiates the flow on the backchannel; the user approves out-of-band on a separate device — here, an **IBM Verify mobile push** that requires a physical tap on the enrolled phone.

```

**Step-by-step:**

1. The agent POSTs `/oauth2/ciba` (bc-authorize) directly to the OIDC Provider ClusterIP with `login_hint=<user_sub>`, `binding_message=<request_id>`, and the refund `authorization_details`. This is machine-to-machine — it bypasses the WRP. IVIA returns an `auth_req_id`.
2. IVIA runs the `notifyuser` mapping rule. In the mobile-push design it does **not** serve a browser consent page — it wires CIBA completion to a server-polled check-status endpoint on the agent via `ExternalAuthenticatorWithCheckStatusEndpoint(<uc3-agent>/api/ciba/status, bearer)`.
3. The agent fires the MMFA push itself, right after bc-authorize, to the authenticated user's IBM Verify device (AAC runtime authsvc policy `mmfa_initiate_simple_login`, message "Approve your OscarVault request"). Identity comes from the authenticated session — never an LLM parameter. The agent records `auth_req_id → {username, transaction_id}`.
4. The user taps **Approve** on the IBM Verify app (physical device, biometric). The MMFA transaction resolves to `SUCCESS` in that user's SCIM record.
5. The agent polls `/oauth2/token` (`grant_type=urn:openid:params:grant-type:ciba`, `auth_req_id`) every 5 seconds for up to 120 seconds. On **each** poll IVIA runs the `checkstatus` rule, which PUTs the agent's `/api/ciba/status` with the CIBA bearer. The agent reads the user's **own** SCIM MMFA transaction for the **exact** push it fired and returns `approved` / `denied` / `pending` — a stale or unrelated SUCCESS cannot complete the flow.
6. When the agent returns `approved`, `checkstatus` calls `ciba.success({sub})` and the `/token` poll returns the access token (`subject_token`) carrying the user's identity. (Deny → `ciba.failed()`; otherwise `ciba.pending()` and the agent keeps polling.)

:::alert{header="Why the approval is unforgeable" type="info"}
Two independent facts must both hold before the refund proceeds: the user physically taps **Approve** on their enrolled device, AND the agent confirms that the **exact** MMFA transaction it fired (matched by `transactionId`, never "any SUCCESS for the user") resolved to `SUCCESS` in that user's own SCIM record. The CIBA bearer is replayed to the check-status endpoint as a per-request shared secret — defense-in-depth on top of the SCIM gate. The backchannel (bc-authorize and token poll) is machine-to-machine and never touches the WRP.

## RFC 8693 Token Exchange

The CIBA access token proves the user approved, but it does not prove *which agent* is acting. Token Exchange (RFC 8693) produces a delegated JWT that carries both.

The Use Case 3 agent presents only the user's token, authenticated as a **separate** OAuth client (`uc3-actor`) via HTTP Basic — IVIA rejects a client exchanging its own token (`FBTAQ5207E`), so no `actor_token` is sent:
- `subject_token` = the CIBA-issued user access token (proves user identity + consent)

IVIA returns a delegated JWT containing:
- `sub` = the approving user (the human who completed the CIBA consent — e.g. `jaime`)
- `act.sub` = `uc3-actor` — injected server-side by the `isvaop_pretoken` mapping rule on the token-exchange grant (proves delegation)
- `authorization_details` = `[{"type": "refund_approval"}]` plus a `vault:path_access` RAR naming the target path — both stamped by `isvaop_pretoken`

The delegated JWT is what the agent presents to Vault via `X-Vault-Token`. Vault's OAuth resource server resolves `act.sub` (= `uc3-actor`) against the Agent Registry and narrows the token per request from its `vault:path_access` RAR before issuing any DB credentials.

:::alert{header="What the phone actually shows — and what binds the amount" type="warning"}
Be precise about what the tap on the phone proves, because it is less than it looks and the rest of the design is built around that.

The push the agent fires is a **user-presence challenge**. It reads "Approve your OscarVault request" and it displays **no amount, no merchant and no transaction** — `fire_push()` sends only the username, and IVIA's authentication policy renders a generic approval. So the human is confirming *that they are present and consent to the pending request*, not inspecting terms on the device.

The terms are not carried on the exchanged token either. IBM Verify (ISVAOP 25.10) exposes the consent-time `authorization_details` only as a context attribute on the request that *carries* it (`bc-authorize`) and as a token-*response* field — it is **not** available to any mapping rule at the CIBA mint or the token-exchange stage, so the amount cannot be stamped as a Vault-validated claim. (Confirmed against the live system and IBM's `tasks-rar` / `js_ciba_mapping_rule` docs, 2026-05-29.) Vault's `vault:path_access` RAR is a path match and could not range-check a number in any case.

What actually binds the amount to the approval is two things you can check yourself:

1. **The agent records the terms when it asks, and re-reads them when it completes.** `initiate_refund` stores the account, transaction, amount, currency and approver against the `auth_req_id`; `complete_refund` takes only the `auth_req_id` and the `request_id` and reads everything else back from that record. The model is never asked for the amount a second time, so it cannot change it between the ask and the write.
2. **The database allows exactly one refund per approval.** A unique index on `banking.refunds (request_id)` makes a second write under the same approval impossible — you prove this by hand on the [Bypass Test](../73-bypass-test/) page, under "One Approval Pays Once".

Together those mean the row written under a `request_id` is the row that was approved, and there is never a second one. That is a real binding, and it is enforced by the agent and the database rather than by the token — which is exactly the sort of thing worth knowing about a system before you trust it.

**The honest limitation:** a user who taps Approve without reading the chat has approved a refund whose amount they were never shown. Displaying the amount on the device needs IVIA's transaction-detail push surface rather than the authentication policy this workshop uses, and that is not deployed here.

### Prove the exchange is gated on the client, not just the token

A fair objection to any delegation story is that the `act.sub` claim is simply stamped on by a mapping rule, so anything that can reach the token endpoint can mint a delegated token. Check it. Both requests below send the **same** junk `subject_token`; only the client credentials differ, so the difference in the answers is attributable to the client alone.

First, resolve both clients' secrets from the cluster — each OAuth client has its own, and they are never in a ConfigMap:

```bash
UC2_SECRET=$(kubectl get secret -n banking-app banking-ui-oidc \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.IVIA_CLIENT_SECRET}' | base64 -d)
ACTOR_SECRET=$(kubectl get secret -n banking-app uc3-oidc-clients \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.IVIA_ACTOR_CLIENT_SECRET}' | base64 -d)
```

Now attempt the RFC 8693 exchange as `agent-uc2` — the Use Case 2 banking client, which is not allowlisted for the token-exchange grant:

```bash
kubectl delete pod ivia-exch-probe -n verify-access --ignore-not-found --now >/dev/null 2>&1
kubectl run ivia-exch-probe --rm -i --quiet --restart=Never --image=curlimages/curl:8.11.1 -n verify-access \
  --command -- curl -sk -X POST https://iviaop.verify-access.svc.cluster.local:8436/oauth2/token \
    -u "agent-uc2:${UC2_SECRET}" \
    -d 'grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange' \
    -d 'subject_token=not-a-real-ciba-token' \
    -d 'subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token' \
    -d 'requested_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token'
```

Expected output — refused on the client, before the token is looked at:

```json
{"error":"unauthorized_client","error_description":"FBTAQ5091E The OAuth 2.0 Client is not allowed to use authorization grant 'urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange'."}
```

Now the same request as `uc3-actor`, the client that *is* allowlisted:

```bash
kubectl delete pod ivia-exch-probe -n verify-access --ignore-not-found --now >/dev/null 2>&1
kubectl run ivia-exch-probe --rm -i --quiet --restart=Never --image=curlimages/curl:8.11.1 -n verify-access \
  --command -- curl -sk -X POST https://iviaop.verify-access.svc.cluster.local:8436/oauth2/token \
    -u "uc3-actor:${ACTOR_SECRET}" \
    -d 'grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange' \
    -d 'subject_token=not-a-real-ciba-token' \
    -d 'subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token' \
    -d 'requested_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token'
```

Expected output — it gets past the client check and dies on the token, which is the *only* thing left to object to:

```json
{"error":"invalid_request","error_description":"FBTAQ5226E Token is not valid or has expired."}
```

Two different refusals from one identical request body. Delegation is not something any caller can ask for: the exchange grant is allowlisted per client, and `uc3-actor` is the only client in this deployment that holds it. A compromised Use Case 2 banking client cannot mint a Use Case 3 delegated token even with a genuine user token in hand — and if it somehow could, `agent-uc2`'s ceiling still omits the refund path, which the [Bypass Test](../73-bypass-test/) proves separately.

:::expand{header="Platform Track — IVIA CIBA Configuration"}
The IVIA CIBA client (`agent-uc3`) is configured in the `verify_access` Terraform module:

- `grant_types`: `["urn:openid:params:grant-type:ciba", "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange"]`
- `token_endpoint_auth_method`: `client_secret_basic`

The provider binds two CIBA mapping rules (`provider.yml`: `notifyuser_mappingrule_id: notifyuser`, `checkstatus_mappingrule_id: checkstatus`) defined in `infrastructure/modules/verify_access/iviaop-config/rules.yaml`:

- **`notifyuser`** runs once during bc-authorize. It sets `ExternalAuthenticatorWithCheckStatusEndpoint(statusUrl, bearer)` where `statusUrl = http://uc3-agent-svc.banking-app.svc.cluster.local:8080/api/ciba/status?auth_req_id=<id>`. This replaces the older `InternalAuthenticator` browser-consent page — there is no browser consent in the mobile-push design.
- **`checkstatus`** runs on every `/token` poll. It `httpPut`s the agent's check-status endpoint with the CIBA bearer and maps the JSON response to `ciba.success({sub})` / `ciba.failed()` / `ciba.pending()`.

The push itself is fired by the agent against the AAC runtime authsvc policy `mmfa_initiate_simple_login` (`base_layer.yaml.tftpl`), which initiates an MMFA user-presence transaction with the message "Approve your OscarVault request".

:::expand{header="Agent Dev Track — Push, Poll, and Check-Status Code"}
The Use Case 3 agent implements the mobile-push flow in `applications/uc3-agent/app/agent.py` and `mmfa.py`:

```python
# 1. Initiate CIBA (direct to OIDC Provider ClusterIP — bypasses WRP)
resp = httpx.post(f"{IVIA_BASE_URL}/oauth2/ciba", data={
    "login_hint": authenticated_sub,        # from the verified session, never the LLM
    "binding_message": request_id,
    "authorization_details": json.dumps(rar),
    "scope": "openid",
}, auth=(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET), verify=IVIA_CA_BUNDLE)
auth_req_id = resp.json()["auth_req_id"]

# 2. The agent fires the MMFA push itself, then records the transaction
txn_id = mmfa.fire_push(authenticated_sub)          # AAC authsvc mmfa_initiate_simple_login
ciba_store.put_txn(auth_req_id, authenticated_sub, txn_id)

# 3. Poll /token; IVIA's checkstatus rule calls back into /api/ciba/status,
#    which reads the user's OWN SCIM transaction for THIS txn_id.
for _ in range(24):                                  # 5s interval, 120s timeout
    time.sleep(5)
    tr = httpx.post(f"{IVIA_BASE_URL}/oauth2/token", data={
        "grant_type": "urn:openid:params:grant-type:ciba",
        "auth_req_id": auth_req_id,
    }, auth=(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET), verify=IVIA_CA_BUNDLE)
    if tr.status_code == 200:
        subject_token = tr.json()["access_token"]
        break
```

The check-status endpoint the agent serves (`main.py`):

```python
@app.put("/api/ciba/status")
async def ciba_status(request, auth_req_id: str):
    entry = ciba_store.get_txn(auth_req_id)          # {username, txn_id}
    status = mmfa.read_txn_status(entry["username"], entry["txn_id"])  # SCIM read
    if status == "approved":
        return {"status": "approved", "uid": entry["username"]}
    return {"status": status}                         # denied | pending
```
:::

## Verification

Check the CIBA mobile-push + token exchange path is working:

```bash
# Confirm the Use Case 3 agent pod is running
kubectl get pods -n banking-app -l app=uc3-agent
```

```bash
# Watch the mobile-push flow in the agent logs (push fired, then check-status polls)
kubectl logs -n banking-app -l app=uc3-agent --tail=-1 | grep -E 'mmfa_push_fired|ciba_status_polled'
```

Two things about that command. `--tail=-1` reads the whole log: with a label selector `kubectl
logs` otherwise returns only the last few lines per pod, and the agent's polling chatter pushes
the push line out of a short window within seconds. And it returns **nothing at all** until you
have actually run a refund — that is the expected state on a fresh deployment, not a fault.

```bash
# Confirm the IVIA CIBA endpoint is reachable from the vault pod (direct ClusterIP path)
kubectl exec -n vault vault-0 -- sh -c \
  "wget -q -O - --no-check-certificate \
  'https://iviaop.verify-access.svc.cluster.local:8436/oauth2/.well-known/openid-configuration'" \
  | jq '.backchannel_authentication_endpoint'
```
